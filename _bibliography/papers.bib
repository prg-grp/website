  abstract = {Although the cloud has reached a state of robustness, the burden of using its resources falls on the shoulders of programmers who struggle to keep up with ever-growing cloud infrastructure services and abstractions. As a result, state management, scaling, operation, and failure management of scalable cloud applications, require disproportionately more effort than developing the applications’ actual business logic.\par Our vision aims to raise the abstraction level for programming scalable cloud applications by compiling \emph{stateful entities} -- a programming model enabling imperative transactional programs authored in Python -- into stateful streaming dataflows. We propose a compiler pipeline that analyzes the abstract syntax tree of stateful entities and transforms them into an intermediate representation based on stateful dataflow graphs. It then compiles that intermediate representation into different dataflow engines, leveraging their exactly-once message processing guarantees to prevent state or failure management primitives from ``leaking'' into the level of the programming model. Preliminary experiments with a proof of concept implementation show that despite program transformation and translation to dataflows, stateful entities can perform at sub-100ms latency even for transactional workloads.},

  abstract = {Programming distributed and concurrent systems is notoriously hard. Active objects, which encapsulate operations, state and control flow, have been investigated by researchers to alleviate this issue. In a distributed system, message exchange among active objects or actors often coincides with network boundaries, and determines a major modularization direction for the application. Yet, certain application functionalities naturally crosscut such modularization direction. For those, structuring the application architecture around network boundaries is purely accidental and does not help reasoning about programs.\par Recently, multitier programming has been proposed as a programming paradigm that enables code that belongs to different peers to be developed together, in the same compilation unit. The compiler then splits the code and generates the required deployment components.\par In this work we explore the relation between multitier programming and active objects. Multitier programming can be considered a programming paradigm based on active objects with a focus on application domains where functionalities span multiple active objects, and allows such functionalities to be encapsulated into a single object. The multitier approach keeps the asynchronous model of active objects and actors but provides a holistic view of distributed components and their interactions. Multitier programming addresses the use cases where separating components into different active objects or actors hinders encapsulation and modularization across functional boundaries. In such use cases, multitier programming can increase the level of abstraction, improve software design, simplify code maintenance, aid program comprehension and enable formal reasoning. A number of features of active objects are directly visible to programmers also in the multitier programming, resulting in an interesting combination of language abstractions available to developers.},

  abstract = {With Programming Languages Infrastructure as Code (PL-IaC), developers implement imperative IaC programs in one of many general-purpose programming languages, e.g., TypeScript, Python, or Go, to declaratively describe deployments. Using these languages provides access to quality assurance techniques and tools developed for traditional software; however, programmers routinely rely on prohibitively slow integration testing – if they test at all. As a result, even simple bugs are found late, tremendously slowing down the development process.\par To improve the velocity of PL-IaC development, we propose ProTI, an automated unit testing approach that quickly tests PL-IaC programs in many different configurations. ProTI mocks all cloud resources, replacing them with pluggable oracles that validate all resources configurations and a generator for realistic test inputs. We implemented ProTI for Pulumi TypeScript with simple generator and oracle plugins. Our experience of testing with ProTI encourages the exploration of more sophisticated oracles and generators, leading to the early detection of more bugs. ProTI enables programmers to rapidly prototype, explore, and plug in new oracles and generators for efficient PL-IaC program testing.},

In recent years, various frameworks have proposed language-level abstractions for this, falling into two fundamental approaches: data-centric and operation-centric solutions. The former allow developers to explicitly assign consistency levels \emph{to data}, the latter enable attaching consistency constraints \emph{to operations}. In practice, developers may benefit from both in the same application: data-centric consistency harmonizes well with object-oriented programming, yet one may need the flexibility to access the same data with a different consistency level depending on the operation. Currently, there is no solution that integrates both: it is a conceptual challenge to unify these two models and design a type system capable of ensuring their correct interaction.\par We present ConOpY, a programming language that integrates both data-centric and operation-centric consistency into the same design. The ConOpY type system guarantees the proper usage of consistency levels, preventing consistency violations resulting from an improper mix of consistency models. ConOpY is implemented as a Java extension based on annotations.},

  abstract = {Several distributed programming language solutions have been proposed to reason about the placement of data, computations, and peers interaction. Such solutions include, among the others, multitier programming, choreographic programming and various approaches based on behavioral types. These methods statically ensure safety properties thanks to a complete knowledge about placement of data and computation at compile time. In distributed systems, however, dynamic placement of computation and data is crucial to enable performance optimizations, e.g., driven by data locality or in presence of a number of other constraints such as security and compliance regarding data storage location. Unfortunately, in existing programming languages, dynamic placement conflicts with static reasoning about distributed programs: the flexibility required by dynamic placement hinders statically tracking the location of data and computation.\par In this paper we present Dyno, a programming language that enables static reasoning about dynamic placement. Dyno features a type system where values are explicitly placed, but in contrast to existing approaches, placed values are also first class, ensuring that they can be passed around and referred to from other locations. Building on top of this mechanism, we provide a novel interpretation of dynamic placement as unions of placement types. We formalize type soundness, placement correctness (as part of type soundness) and architecture conformance. In case studies and benchmarks, our evaluation shows that Dyno enables static reasoning about programs even in presence of dynamic placement, ensuring type safety and placement correctness of programs at negligible performance cost. We reimplement an Android app with 7K LOC in Dyno, find a bug in the existing implementation, and show that the app's approach is representative of a common way to implement dynamic placement found in over 100 apps in a large open-source app store.},

  abstract = {Decentralized applications (dApps) consist of smart contracts that run on blockchains and clients that model collaborating parties. dApps are used to model financial and legal business functionality. Today, contracts and clients are written as separate programs -- in different programming languages -- communicating via send and receive operations. This makes distributed program flow awkward to express and reason about, increasing the potential for mismatches in the client-contract interface, which can be exploited by malicious clients, potentially leading to huge financial losses.\par In this paper, we present Prisma, a language for tierless decentralized applications, where the contract and its clients are defined in one unit and pairs of send and receive actions that ``belong together'' are encapsulated into a single direct-style operation, which is executed differently by sending and receiving parties. This enables expressing distributed program flow via standard control flow and renders mismatching communication impossible. We prove formally that our compiler preserves program behavior in presence of an attacker controlling the client code. We systematically compare Prisma with mainstream and advanced programming models for dApps and provide empirical evidence for its expressiveness and performance.},

In particular, the popular do-notation provides a lightweight effect embedding for any instance of a monad. Idiom bracket notation, on the other hand, provides an embedding for applicatives. First, while monads force effects to be executed sequentially, ignoring potential for parallelism, applicatives do not support sequential effects. Composing sequential with parallel effects remains an open problem. This is even more of an issue as real programs consist of a combination of both sequential and parallel segments. Second, common notations do not support invoking effects in direct-style, instead forcing a rigid structure upon the code.\par In this paper, we propose a mixed applicative/monadic notation that retains parallelism where possible, but allows sequentiality where necessary. We leverage a direct-style notation where sequentiality or parallelism is derived from the structure of the code. We provide a mechanisation of our effectful language in Coq and prove that our compilation approach retains the parallelism of the source program.},

For correct operation, CRDTs rely on a merge function that is commutative, associative and idempotent. Ensuring that such algebraic properties are satisfied by implementations, however, is left to the programmer, resulting in a process that is complex and error-prone. While techniques based on testing, automatic verification of a model, and mechanized or handwritten proofs are available, we lack an approach that is able to verify such properties on concrete CRDT implementations.\par In this paper, we present Propel, a programming language with a type system that captures the algebraic properties required by a correct CRDT implementation. The Propel type system deduces such properties by case analysis and induction: sum types guide the case analysis and algebraic properties in function types enable induction for free. Propel's key feature is its capacity to reason about algebraic properties (a) in terms of rewrite rules and (b) to derive the equality or inequality of expressions from the properties. We provide an implementation of Propel as a Scala embedding, we implement several CRDTs, verify them with Propel and compare the verification process with four state-of-the-art verification tools. Our evaluation shows that Propel is able to automatically deduce the properties that are relevant for common CRDT implementations found in open-source libraries even in cases in which competitors timeout.},

The contribution of this paper is a comparison of MicroK8s, k3s, k0s, and MicroShift, investigating their minimal resource usage as well as control plane and data plane performance in stress scenarios. While k3s and k0s showed by a small amount the highest control plane throughput and MicroShift showed the highest data plane throughput, usability, security, and maintainability are additional factors that drive the decision for an appropriate distribution.},

A growing number of cloud solutions have been continuously attempting to address each of these challenges as a result of the increasing popularity of FaaS. Yet, the characteristics of this model have been poorly understood; therefore, the challenges are poorly tackled. In this paper, we assess the state of FaaS in open-source community with a study on almost 2K real-world serverless applications. Our results show a jeopardized ecosystem, where, despite the hype of serverless solutions in the last years, a number of challenges remain untackled, especially concerning component reuse, support for software development, and flexibility among different platforms -- resulting in arguably slow adoption of the FaaS model.

The key building component of a TDC is a delay line, typically implemented as a chain of fast carry propagation multiplexers. In FPGAs, the fast carry chains are constrained to dedicated logic and routing, and need to be routed strictly vertically. In this work, we present an alternative approach to designing on-chip voltage sensors, in which the FPGA routing resources replace the carry logic. We present three variants of what we name a routing delay sensor (RDS): one vertically constrained, one horizontally constrained, and one free of any constraints. We perform a thorough experimental evaluation on both the Sakura-X side-channel evaluation board and the Alveo U200 datacenter card, to evaluate the performance of RDS sensors in the context of a remote power side-channel analysis attack. The results show that our best RDS implementation in most cases outperforms the TDC. On average, for breaking the full 128-bit key of an AES-128 cryptographic core, an adversary requires 35\% fewer side-channel traces when using the RDS than when using the TDC. Besides making the attack more effective, given the absence of the placement and routing constraint, the RDS sensor is also easier to deploy.},

There is still a lack of experience reports applying OASIS TOSCA in real-world settings, therefore the benefits and drawbacks of using this technology are still not well understood. In this context, we designed a simple DCS consisting of several microservices modelled in TOSCA and implemented an according TOSCA orchestrator. We executed a case study deploying the microservices to an on-premise and a cloud-based Kubernetes environment. While TOSCA provides a sophisticated object-oriented language, we found a few specification gaps, challenges when creating portable service templates, and challenges for synchronizing TOSCA orchestrators with DCS engineering tools as well as container orchestrators.

Their reliability is crucial because their failure prevents the deployment of applications, and incorrect behavior can introduce malfunction and severe security issues. Yet, software engineering tools to develop reliable programs, such as testing and verification, are barely used in IaC. In fact, we observed that developers mainly rely on integration testing, a slow and expensive practice that can increase confidence in end-to-end functionality but is infeasible to systematically test IaC programs in various configurations---which is required to ensure robustness. On the other hand, fast testing techniques, such as unit testing, are cumbersome with IaC programs because, today, they require significant coding overhead while only providing limited confidence.\par To solve this issue, we envision the automated testing tool ProTI, reducing the manual overhead and boosting confidence in the test results. ProTI embraces modern unit testing techniques to test IaC programs in many different configurations. Out of the box, ProTI is a fuzzer for Pulumi TypeScript IaC programs, randomly testing the program in many different configurations for termination, configuration correctness, and existing policy compliance. Then developers can add specifications to their program to guide random-based value generation, test additional properties, and add further mocking, making ProTI a property-based testing tool.

  abstract = {Modern DevOps organizations require a high degree of automation to achieve software stability at frequent changes. Further, there is a need for flexible, timely reconfiguration of the infrastructure, e.g., to use pay-per-use infrastructure efficiently based on application load. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the DevOps tool to automate infrastructure. However, modern \emph{static IaC} solutions only support infrastructures that are deployed and do not change afterward. To implement infrastructures that change \emph{dynamically} over time, static IaC programs have to be (updated and) re-run, e.g., in a CI/CD pipeline, or configure an external orchestrator that implements the dynamic behavior, e.g., an autoscaler or Kubernetes operator. Both do not capture the dynamic behavior in the IaC program and prevent analyzing and testing the infrastructure configuration jointly with its dynamic behavior.\par To fill this gap, we envision \emph{dynamic IaC}, which augments static IaC with the ability to define dynamic behavior within the IaC program. In contrast to static IaC programs, dynamic IaC programs run continuously. They re-evaluate program parts that depend on external signals when these change and automatically adjust the infrastructure accordingly. We implement DIaC as the first dynamic IaC solution and demonstrate it in two realistic use cases of broader relevance. With dynamic IaC, ensuring the program's correctness is even harder than for static IaC because programs may define many target configurations in contrast to only a few. However, for this reason, it is also more critical. To solve this issue, we propose automated, specialized property-based testing for IaC programs and implement it in ProTI.},

For the homogeneous case, we investigate an experimental language design that aims to push the abstraction boundaries farther, compared to existing approaches.\par In this paper, we introduce the design of XC, a programming language to develop homogeneous distributed systems. In XC, developers define the single program that every device executes and the overall behavior is achieved collectively, in an emergent way. The programming framework transparently takes care of concurrency, asynchronous execution, message loss, and device failures. We propose a minimalistic design, which features a single declarative primitive for communication, state management and connection management. A mechanism called \emph{alignment} enables developers to abstract over asynchronous execution while still retaining composability. We define syntax and operational semantics of a core calculus, prove a number of properties of the calculus, including type soundness. XC comes with two DSL implementations: a DSL in Scala and one in C++. An evaluation based on smart-city monitoring demonstrates XC in a realistic application.},

Today, contracts and clients are written as separate programs -- in different programming languages -- communicating via send and receive operations. This makes distributed program flow awkward to express and reason about, increasing the potential for mismatches in the client-contract interface, which can be exploited by malicious clients, potentially leading to huge financial losses.\par In this paper, we present Prisma, a language for tierless decentralized applications, where the contract and its clients are defined in one unit and pairs of send and receive actions that “belong together” are encapsulated into a single direct--style operation, which is executed differently by sending and receiving parties. This enables expressing distributed program flow via standard control flow and renders mismatching communication impossible. We prove formally that our compiler preserves program behavior in presence of an attacker controlling the client code. We systematically compare Prisma with mainstream and advanced programming models for dApps and provide empirical evidence for its expressiveness and performance.},

Traditionally, updates are performed by shutting down the system to replace certain components. In modern software organizations, updates are increasingly frequent---up to multiple times per day---hence, shutting down the entire system is unacceptable. \emph{Safe} dynamic software updating (DSU) enables component updates while the system is running by determining \emph{when} the update can occur without causing errors. Safe DSU is crucial, especially for long-running or frequently executed asynchronous transactions (\emph{workflows}), e.g., user-interactive sessions and order fulfillment processes. Unfortunately, previous research is limited to synchronous transaction models and does not address this case.\par In this work, we propose a unified model for safe DSU in workflows. We discuss how state-of-the-art DSU solutions fit into this model and show that they incur significant overhead. To improve the performance, we introduce Essential Safety, a novel safe DSU approach that leverages the notion of \emph{non-essential} changes, i.e., semantics preserving updates. In 106 realistic collaborative BPMN workflows, Essential Safety reduces the delay of workflow completions, on average, by 47.8\% compared to the state of the art. We show that the distinction of essential and non-essential changes plays a crucial role in this reduction and that, as suggested in literature, non-essential changes are frequent: at least 60\% and often more than 90\% of systems' updates in eight monorepos we analyze.},

In our previous work, we addressed this issue by enabling transitions, which allow for the adaptive use of operator placement mechanisms. In this article, we extend the transition methodology by optimizing the costs of transition and analyzing the behavior using multiple operator placement mechanisms. Furthermore, we provide an extensive evaluation on the costs of transition imposed by operator migrations and learning, as it can inflict overhead on the performance if operated uncoordinatedly.},

This issue is currently solved either with a central deployment or manual out-of-band communication across teams, e.g., via phone, chat, or email. Unfortunately, both contradict the independence of teams, hindering SDO performance -- the reason why DevOps is adopted in the first place.\par In this work, we conduct a study on 73 IT professionals, showing that, in practice, they resort to manual coordination for correct deployments even if they expect better SDO performance with fully automated approaches.

Many hardware vendors offer different implementations of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). A TEE is a hardware protected execution environment that allows performing confidential computations over sensitive data on untrusted hosts. Despite the appeal of achieving strong security guarantees against low-level attackers, two challenges hinder the adoption of TEEs. First, developing software in high-level managed languages, e.g., Java or Scala, taking advantage of existing TEEs is complex and error-prone. Second, partitioning an application into components that run inside and outside a TEE may break application-level security policies, resulting in an insecure application when facing a realistic attacker.\par In this work, we study both these challenges. We present J<sub>E</sub>, a programming model that seamlessly integrates a TEE, abstracting away low-level programming details such as initialization and loading of data into the TEE. J<sub>E</sub> only requires developers to add annotations to their programs to enable the execution within the TEE. Drawing on information flow control, we develop a security type system that checks confidentiality and integrity policies against realistic attackers with full control over the code running outside the TEE. We formalize the security type system for the J<sub>E</sub> core and prove it sound for a semantic characterization of security. We implement J<sub>E</sub> and the security type system, enable Java programs to run on Intel SGX with strong security guarantees. We evaluate our approach on use cases from the literature, including a battleship game, a secure event processing system, and a popular processing framework for big data, showing that we correctly handle complex cases of partitioning, information flow, declassification, and trust.},

  abstract = {Today's software, including many everyday services, such as online streaming, search engines and social networks, is widely distributed, running on top of a network of interconnected computers. Such distributed applications are traditionally developed as separate modules for each component in the distributed system. These modules react to events, like user input or messages from the network, and in turn produce new events for the other modules. Separation into different modules is problematic because combining modules is notoriously hard and requires extensive and time-consuming integration and manual implementation of communication forces programmers to program complex event-based communication schemes among hosts ? an activity which is often low-level and error-prone. The combination of the two results in obscure distributed data flows scattered among multiple modules, hindering reasoning about the system as a whole. For these reasons, despite most software today is distributed, the design and development of distributed systems remains surprisingly challenging.\par We present the ScalaLoci distributed programming language, our approach for taming the complexity of developing distributed applications via specialized programming language support. ScalaLoci addresses the issues above with a coherent model based on placement types that enables reasoning about distributed data flows otherwise scattered across multiple modules, supporting multiple software architectures via dedicated language features and abstracting over low-level communication details and data conversions.\par ScalaLoci does not force developers to modularize software along network boundaries as is traditionally the case when developing distributed systems. Instead, we propose a module system that supports encapsulating each (cross-host) functionality and defining it over abstract peer types. As a result, we disentangle modularization and distribution and we enable the definition of a distributed system as a composition of ScalaLoci modules, each representing a subsystem.\par Our case studies on distributed algorithms, distributed data structures, as well as on real-world distributed streaming engines show that ScalaLoci simplifies developing distributed systems, reduces error-prone communication code and favors early detection of bugs. As we demonstrate, the ScalaLoci module system allows the definition of reusable patterns of interaction in distributed software and enables separating the modularization and distribution concerns, properly separating functionalities in distributed systems.},

  abstract = {Pressed by the difficulty of writing asynchronous, event-driven code, mainstream languages have recently been building in support for a variety of advanced control-flow features. Meanwhile, experimental language designs have suggested effect handlers as a unifying solution to programmer-defined control effects, subsuming exceptions, generators, and async--await. However, despite these trends, complex control flow---in particular, control flow that exhibits a bidirectional pattern---remains challenging to manage.\par We introduce \emph{bidirectional algebraic effects}, a new programming abstraction that supports bidirectional control transfer in a more natural way. Handlers of bidirectional effects can raise further effects to transfer control back to the site where the initiating effect was raised, and can use themselves to handle their own effects. We present applications of this expressive power, which falls out naturally as we push toward the unification of effectful programming with object-oriented programming. We pin down the mechanism and the unification formally using a core language that makes generalizations to effect operations and effect handlers.\par The usual propagation semantics of control effects such as exceptions conflicts with modular reasoning in the presence of effect polymorphism---it breaks parametricity. Bidirectionality exacerbates the problem. Hence, we set out to show the core language, which builds on the existing tunneling semantics for algebraic effects, is not only type-safe (no effects go unhandled), but also abstraction-safe (no effects are \emph{accidentally} handled). We devise a step-indexed logical-relations model, and construct its parametricity and soundness proofs. These core results are fully mechanized in Coq. While a full-featured compiler is left to future work, experiments show that as a first-class language feature, bidirectional handlers can be implemented efficiently.},

However, these benefits are not yet at the fingertips of HPC developers: Typical HPC applications use \emph{on-premise} computing resources and rely on static deployment setups, reliable hardware, and rather homogeneous resources. This hinders (partial) execution in the cloud, even though applications could benefit from scaling beyond on-premise resources and from the variety of hardware available in the cloud to speed up execution.\par To address this issue, we orchestrate computationally intensive kernels using a high-level programming language that ensures advanced optimization and improves execution flexibility-enabling hybrid cloud/on-premise HPC deployments. Our approach is based on multitier reactive programming, where distributed code is defined within the same compilation unit and computations are placed explicitly using placement types. We adjust placement based on performance characteristics measured before execution, apply our approach to a shortest vector problem (SVP) solver from cryptanalysis, and evaluate it to be effective.},

Ultimately, the goal of the multitier approach is to improve program comprehension, simplify maintenance and enable formal reasoning about the properties of the \emph{whole} distributed application.\par A number of multitier research languages have been proposed over the last decade, which support various degrees of multitier programming and explore different design tradeoffs.

Specifically, we propose a calculus that enables formal reasoning about applications' dataflow within and across individual devices. Our calculus reinterprets the functional reactive programming model to seamlessly integrate its automated state change propagation with automated crash recovery of device-local dataflow and disconnection-tolerant distribution with guaranteed automated eventual consistency semantics based on conflict-free replicated datatypes. As a result, programmers are relieved of handling intricate details of distributing change propagation and coping with distribution failures in the presence of interactivity. We also provides proofs of our claims, an implementation of our calculus, and an empirical evaluation using a common interactive application.},

Second, constraint solving selects the best placement among the candidates based on a cost model that maximizes performance.

We equip SafeP4 with a formal semantics and a static type system that statically guarantees header validity -- a common source of safety bugs according to our analysis of real-world P4 programs. Statically ensuring header validity is challenging because the set of valid headers can be modified at runtime, making it a dynamic program property. Our type system achieves static safety by using a form of path-sensitive reasoning that tracks dynamic information from conditional statements, routing tables, and the control plane.

  abstract = {Multitier programming languages address the complexity of developing distributed systems abstracting over low level implementation details such as data representation, serialization and network protocols. Since the functionalities of different peers can be defined in the same compilation unit, multitier languages do not force developers to modularize software along network boundaries. Unfortunately, combining the code for all tiers into the same compilation unit poses a scalability challenge or forces developers to resort to traditional modularization abstractions that are agnostic to the multitier nature of the language.\par In this paper, we address this issue with a module system for multitier languages. Our module system supports encapsulating each (cross-peer) functionality and defining it over abstract peer types. As a result, we disentangle modularization and distribution and we enable the definition of a distributed system as a composition of multitier modules, each representing a subsystem. Our case studies on distributed algorithms, distributed data structures, as well as on the Apache Flink task distribution system, show that multitier modules allow the definition of reusable (abstract) patterns of interaction in distributed software and enable separating the modularization and distribution concerns, properly separating functionalities in distributed systems.},

  abstract = {The pivotal role that event correlation technology plays in todays applications has lead to the emergence of different families of event correlation approaches with a multitude of specialized correlation semantics, including computation models that support the composition and extension of different semantics.\par However, type-safe embeddings of extensible and composable event patterns into statically-typed generalpurpose programming languages have not been systematically explored so far. This is unfortunate, as typesafe embedding of event patterns is important to enable increased correctness of event correlation computations as well as domain-specific optimizations. Event correlation technology has often adopted well-known and intuitive notations from database queries, for which approaches to type-safe embedding do exist. However, we argue in the paper that these approaches, which are essentially descendants of the work on monadic comprehensions, are not well-suited for event correlations and, thus, cannot without further ado be reused/repurposed for embedding event patterns.\par To close this gap we propose PolyJoin, a novel approach to type-safe embedding for fully polyvariadic event patterns with polymorphic correlation semantics. Our approach is based on a tagless final encoding with uncurried higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) representation of event patterns withn variables, for arbitrary $n \in{} \mathbb{N}$. Thus, our embedding is defined in terms of the host language without code generation and exploits the host language type system to model and type check the type system of the pattern language. Hence, by construction it impossible to define ill-typed patterns. We show that it is possible to have a purely \emph{library-level} embedding of event patterns, in the familiar join query notation, which is not restricted to monads. PolyJoin is practical, type-safe and extensible. An implementation of it in pure multicore OCaml is readily usable.},

In a multi-threaded environment, multiple such interactions may execute concurrently, potentially causing data races and event ordering ambiguities. Existing RP languages either disable multi-threading or handle it at the cost of reducing expressiveness or weakening consistency. This paper proposes a model for thread-safe reactive programming (RP) that ensures abort-free strict serializability under concurrency while sacrificing neither expressiveness nor consistency. We also propose an architecture for integrating a corresponding scheduler into the RP language runtime, such that thread-safety is provided "out-of-the-box" to the applications.\par We show the feasibility of our proposal by providing and evaluating a ready-to-use implementation integrated into the REScala programming language. The scheduling algorithm is formally proven correct. A thorough empirical evaluation shows that reactive applications build on top of it scale with multiple threads, while the scheduler incurs acceptable performance overhead in a single-threaded configuration. The scalability enabled by our scheduler is roughly on-par with that of hand-crafted application-specific locking and better than the scalability enabled by a scheduler using an off-the-shelf software transactional memory library.},

Complementary information that could improve the analyses is either ignored by making a sound over-approximation or it is also computed by the analyses, but at a rudimentary level. For example, an immutability analysis requires field mutability information, alias/escape information, and information about the concurrent behavior of methods to correctly classify classes like java.lang.String or java.util.BigDecimal. As a result, without properly supporting the integration of independently developed, mutually benefiting analysis, many analyses will not correctly classify relevant entities.We propose to use explicitly reified lattices that encode the information about a source code element's properties (e.g., a method's purity or a class' immutability) as the sole interface between mutually dependent analyses. This enables the composition of multiple analyses. Our case study shows that using such an approach enables highly scalable, lightweight implementations of modularized static analyses.},

Effect handlers act as modular interpreters of event notifications, enabling fine-grained control abstractions and customizable event matching. Join variants can be considered as cartesian product computations with ``degenerate'' control flow, such that unnecessary tuples are not materialized a priori. Based on this computational interpretation, we decompose joins into a generic, naïve enumeration procedure of the cartesian product, plus variant-specific extensions, represented in terms of user-supplied effect handlers. Our microbenchmarks validate that this extensible design avoids needless materialization. Alongside a formal semantics for joining and prototypes in Koka and multicore OCaml, we contribute a systematic comparison of the covered domains and features.},

In this paper, we present multimodal CEP, a novel approach to process streams of events on-device in user space (user mode), in the operating system (kernel mode), on the Wi-Fi chip (Wi-Fi mode), and/or on a sensor hub (hub mode), providing significant improvements in terms of power consumption and throughput. Multimodal CEP automatically breaks up CEP queries and selects the most adequate execution mode for the involved CEP operators. Filter, aggregation, and correlation operators can be expressed in a high-level language without requiring system-level domain-specific knowledge. Multimodal CEP enables developers to efficiently detect user activities, collect environmental conditions, or interpret operating system and network events. Furthermore, it facilitates novel context-aware services, demonstrated by a use case for gathering and analyzing mobility data by Wi-Fi probe request tracking.},

By enabling transitions, TCEP can \emph{seamlessly} exchange distinct operator mechanisms at runtime. We make two main contributions that are highly important for a \emph{cost-efficient} transition: i) a transition strategy for efficiently scheduling state migrations and ii) a lightweight learning algorithm to adaptively select an appropriate placement mechanism as a consequence of a transition. Our evaluations for important decentralized placement mechanisms in the context of an IoT scenario show that transitions can better fulfill QoS demands in a dynamic environment. Thereby efficient scheduling of state migrations can help to faster complete transitions by up to 94\%.},

Establishing suitable abstractions for distributed reactive programming demands for a deeper investigation of the semantics of change propagation. This paper takes a foundational approach and defines precise propagation semantics in terms of consistency guarantees that constrain the order and isolation of value updates. We study the benefits and costs of these consistency guarantees both theoretically and empirically, using case studies and synthetic benchmarks. We show that different applications require different levels of consistency and that manually implementing the required level on a middleware that provides a lower one annuls the abstraction improvements of reactive programming. This motivates a framework that enables the developers to select the best trade-off between consistency and overhead for the problem at hand. To this end, we present DREAM, a distributed reactive programming middleware with flexible consistency guarantees.},

However, an important assumption behind this line of research is that, beside other claimed advantages, reactive programming makes a wide class of otherwise cumbersome applications more comprehensible. This claim has never been evaluated. In this paper, we present the first empirical study that evaluates the effect of reactive programming on comprehension. The study involves&nbsp;127 subjects and compares reactive programming to the traditional object-oriented style with the Observer design pattern. Our findings show that program comprehension is significantly enhanced by the reactive-programming paradigm---a result that suggests to further develop research in this field.},

High consistency is required for critical tasks such as payment and identification. Modern (geo-)distributed systems rely on the data propagation mechanisms and consistency guarantees of the distributed data store they build upon, which makes the implementation of a system that mixes different levels of consistency complex and error prone. In this paper we present preliminary work on ConSysT, a programming language that supports heterogeneous consistency specifications at the type level. In ConSysT, developers assign consistency levels directly to the data and the type system ensures the correct behavior of the application even with computations that mix data at multiple consistency levels. Our vision is that the ConSysT runtime automatically determines the most efficient mechanism to achieve the desired level of consistency among those offered by the underlying data store.},

CEP provides efficient means to detect (complex) events corresponding to environmental changes by performing a real-time analysis on many, possibly heterogeneous, data sources. The way current CEP systems detect events is determined at design time without accounting for dynamic changes of the environment monitored by the CEP system. This can lead to situations where the performance, quality and reliability of event detection significantly drop (e.g., due to mobility) since initial assumptions of the environment are violated or stated too general. In this paper, we propose AdaptiveCEP, a CEP system that is able to self-adapt to detected changes in environmental conditions. We propose a CEP query language that allows specifying changes in the behavior of the CEP system and its mechanisms in detecting events dependent on environmental conditions. This way, AdaptiveCEP can select the best-suited configurations for given quality demands. In our evaluation, we show by means of a reference concept how the flexibility exposed by the query language helps to achieve significant performance gains.},

Deterministic-by-construction concurrent programming models avoid this issue, but they typically restrict expressiveness in important ways.\par This paper introduces a concurrent programming model, Reactive Async, which decouples concurrent computations using so-called \emph{cells}, shared locations which generalize futures as well as recent deterministic abstractions such as LVars. Compared to previously proposed programming models Reactive Async provides (a) a fallback mechanism for the case where no computation ever computes the value of a given cell, and (b) explicit and optimized handling of cyclic dependencies. We present a complete implementation of the Reactive Async programming model as a library in Scala. Finally, the paper reports on a case study applying Reactive Async to static analyses of JVM bytecode based on the Opal framework.},

Despite advances in cryptographic techniques have improved the expressivity of such programs, integration with mainstream languages has seen little progress. To this end, we present SecureScala, a domain-specific language in Scala that allows expressing secure programs without requiring any cryptographic knowledge. SecureScala is based on a novel combination of free monads and free applicative functors and supports parallel execution and static analyzability. We evaluate our approach through several case studies, demonstrate its expressivity, and show that it incurs in limited performance overhead.},

But designers of some recent languages have argued that the benefits of statically checked exceptions are not worth the costs. We introduce a new statically checked exception mechanism that addresses the problems with existing checked-exception mechanisms. In particular, it interacts well with higher-order functions and other design patterns. The key insight is that whether an exception should be treated as a "checked" exception is not a property of its type but rather of the context in which the exception propagates. Statically checked exceptions can "tunnel" through code that is oblivious to their presence, but the type system nevertheless checks that these exceptions are handled. Further, exceptions can be tunneled without being accidentally caught, by expanding the space of exception identifiers to identify the exception-handling context. The resulting mechanism is expressive and syntactically light, and can be implemented efficiently. We demonstrate the expressiveness of the mechanism using significant codebases and evaluate its performance. We have implemented this new exception mechanism as part of the new Genus programming language, but the mechanism could equally well be applied to other programming languages.},

Furthermore, deployment languages do not provide extension points for custom implementations of existing cloud services such as application-specific load balancing policies.\par To address these shortcomings, we propose CPL (\emph{Cloud Platform Language}), a statically-typed core language for programming both distributed applications as well as their deployment on a cloud platform. In CPL, application services and deployment programs interact through statically typed, extensible interfaces, and an application can trigger further deployment at run time. We provide a formal semantics of CPL and demonstrate that it enables type-safe, composable and extensible libraries of \emph{service combinators}, such as load balancing and fault tolerance.},

We introduce an expressive genericity mechanism that adds expressive power and strengthens static checking, while remaining lightweight and simple in common use cases. Like type classes and concepts, the mechanism allows existing types to model type constraints retroactively. For expressive power, we expose \emph{models} as named constructs that can be defined and selected explicitly to witness constraints; in common uses of genericity, however, types implicitly witness constraints without additional programmer effort. Models are integrated into the object-oriented style, with features like model generics, model-dependent types, model enrichment, model multimethods, constraint entailment, model inheritance, and existential quantification further extending expressive power in an object-oriented setting. We introduce the new genericity features and show that common generic programming idioms, including current generic libraries, can be expressed more precisely and concisely. The static semantics of the mechanism and a proof of a key decidability property can be found in an associated technical report.},

Context-oriented programming (COP) has been recently proposed as a specialized programming paradigm for context-aware and adaptive systems. COP mostly focuses on run time adaptation of the application's behavior by supporting modular descriptions of behavioral variations. However, self-adaptive applications must satisfy additional requirements, such as distribution and concurrency, support for unforeseen changes and enforcement of correct behavior in the presence of dynamic change. Addressing these issues at the language level requires a holistic design that covers all aspects and takes into account the possibly cumbersome interaction of those features, for example concurrency and dynamic change.\par We present ContextErlang, a COP programming language in which adaptive abstractions are seamlessly integrated with distribution and concurrency. We define ContextErlang's formal semantics, validated through an executable prototype, and we show how it supports formal proofs that the language design ensures satisfaction of certain safety requirements. We provide empirical evidence that ContextErlang is an effective solution through case studies and a performance assessment. We also show how the same design principles that lead to the development of ContextErlang can be followed to systematically design contextual extensions of other languages. A concrete example is presented concerning ContextScala.},

Modern software increasingly processes massive amounts of data, whereby it is also often the case that new input data is produced and/or existing data is modified on the fly. Consequently, programming models that facilitate the development of such software are emerging. What characterizes them is that data, respectively changes thereof, implicitly flow through computation modules. The software engineer declaratively defines computations as compositions of other computations without explicitly modeling how data should flow along dependency relations between data producer and data consumer modules, letting the runtime to automatically manage and optimize data flows.},

In particular, it introduces three propagation semantics, namely \emph{causal}, \emph{glitch free}, and \emph{atomic}, providing different trade-offs between costs and guarantees. Furthermore, it describes how these semantics are concretely implemented in a Distributed REActice Middleware (DREAM), which exploits a distributed event-based dispatching system to propagate changes.\par We compare the performance of DREAM in a wide range of scenarios. This allows us to study the overhead introduced by the different semantics in terms of network traffic and propagation delay and to assess the efficiency of DREAM in supporting distributed reactive systems.},

This leads to confusion and difficulty---more for researchers than for practitioners---for example, when comparing coverage of different antivirus engines, when integrating and systematizing known threats, or comparing the classifications given by different detectors. Clearly, solving naming inconsistencies is a very difficult task, as it requires that vendors agree on a unified naming convention. More importantly, solving inconsistencies is impossible without knowing exactly where they are. Therefore, in this paper we take a step back and concentrate on the problem of finding inconsistencies. To this end, we first represent each vendor's naming convention with a graph-based model. Second, we give a precise definition of inconsistency with respect to these models. Third, we define two quantitative measures to calculate the overall degree of inconsistency between vendors. In addition, we propose a fast algorithm that finds non-trivial (i.e., beyond syntactic differences) inconsistencies. Our experiments on four major antivirus vendors and 98,798 real-world malware samples confirm anecdotal observations that different vendors name viruses differently. More importantly, we were able to find inconsistencies that cannot be inferred at all by looking solely at the syntax.},

Current systems for automated malware analysis typically follow a dynamic approach, executing an unknown program in a controlled environment (sandbox) and recording its runtime behavior. Since dynamic analysis platforms directly run malicious code, they are resilient to popular malware defense techniques such as packing and code obfuscation. Unfortunately, in many cases, only a small subset of all possible malicious behaviors is observed within the short time frame that a malware sample is executed. To mitigate this issue, previous work introduced techniques such as multi-path or forced execution to increase the coverage of dynamic malware analysis. Unfortunately, using these techniques is potentially expensive, as the number of paths that require analysis can grow exponentially.\par In this paper, we propose Reanimator, a novel solution to determine the capabilities (malicious functionality) of malware programs. Our solution is based on the insight that we can leverage behavior observed while dynamically executing a specific malware sample to identify similar functionality in other programs. More precisely, when we observe malicious actions during dynamic analysis, we automatically extract and model the parts of the malware binary that are responsible for this behavior. We then leverage these models to check whether similar code is present in other samples. This allows us to statically identify \emph{dormant functionality} (functionality that is not observed during dynamic analysis) in malicious programs. We evaluate our approach on thousands of real-world malware samples, and we show that our system is successful in identifying additional, malicious functionality. As a result, our approach can significantly improve the coverage of malware analysis results.},

Although context-oriented programming has been around for a while, most existing efforts focus on incorporating context-oriented features in languages that are not primarily oriented to concurrency, distribution, and dynamic reconfiguration. These features, however, characterize most pervasive context-aware situations.

  abstract = {The problem of formal software specification has been addressed and discussed since the infancy of software engineering. However, among all the proposed solutions, none is universally accepted yet. Many different formal descriptions can in fact be given for the same software component; thus, the problem of determining the consistency relation among those descriptions becomes relevant and potentially critical. In this work, we propose a method for comparing two specific kinds of formal specifications of containers. In particular, we check the consistency of intensional behavior models with algebraic specifications. The consistency check is performed by generating a behavioral equivalence model from the intensional model, converting the algebraic axioms into temporal logic formulae, and then checking them against the model by using the NuSMV model checker. An automated software tool which encodes the problem as model checking has been implemented to check the consistency of recovered specifications of relevant Java classes.},

  abstract = {Anomaly-based techniques were exploited successfully to implement protection mechanisms for various systems. Recently, these approaches have been ported to the web domain under the name of "web application anomaly detectors" (or firewalls) with promising results. In particular, those capable of automatically building specifications, or models, of the protected application by observing its traffic (e.g., network packets, system calls, or HTTP requests and responses) are particularly interesting, since they can be deployed with little effort.\par Typically, the detection accuracy of these systems is significantly influenced by the model building phase (often called training), which clearly depends upon the quality of the observed traffic, which should resemble the normal activity of the protected application and must be also free from attacks. Otherwise, detection may result in significant amounts of false positives (i.e., benign events flagged as anomalous) and negatives (i.e., undetected threats).\par In this work we describe Masibty, a web application anomaly detector that have some interesting properties. First, it requires the training data not to be attack-free. Secondly, not only it protects the monitored application, it also detects and blocks malicious client-side threats before they are sent to the browser. Third, Masibty intercepts the queries before they are sent to the database, correlates them with the corresponding HTTP requests and blocks those deemed anomalous.\par Both the accuracy and the performance have been evaluated on real-world web applications with interesting results. The system is almost not influenced by the presence of attacks in the training data and shows only a negligible amount of false positives, although this is paid in terms of a slight performance overhead.},

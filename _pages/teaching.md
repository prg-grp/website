Teaching is one of our core contributions at the HSG and TU Darmstadt.
Besides sharing knowledge with new generations of computer scientists,
we value the insights and view of the continuously renewing student body on our disciplines.
Further, we enjoy close research collaboration with motivated students,
often performed as a thesis or in a HiWi position.
We invite you to join our [courses](#courses),
to write a [thesis](#theses) with us or to [join us as a HiWi or PhD student]({{ '/open-positions' | relative_url }}).

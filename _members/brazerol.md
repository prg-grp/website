I am currently a master’s student at the University of Zurich, specializing in software systems. Since October 2022, I have been working as a full-stack junior developer, primarily focusing on building web applications for internal use.

I am passionate about the intersection of software engineering and mathematics and have a strong interest in computer graphics, which I try to study and experiment with in my free time.

My research interests include Programming Languages,
Information Flow Control and Trusted Execution Environments.
I worked on language abstractions for secure programming with trusted execution environments under the project [CROSSING](https://www.crossing.tu-darmstadt.de/crc_1119/index.en.jsp){: target="_blank" }.

I am one of the developers of the [J<sub>E</sub>](https://prg-grp.github.io/je-lang/){: target="_blank" } languageâ€”a language for secure Java programming with Intel SGX.

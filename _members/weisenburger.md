description: Profile of Dr. Pascal Weisenburger, Postdoctoral Researcher at the Programming Group.
lastname: Weisenburger
publications: 'author^=*Weisenburger'

teaser: >
    My current research focuses on the design of languages for distributed systems
    with a wide range of software architectures – e.g., peer-to-peer, cloud, edge, serverless, IoT –
    regarding sound programming models for the interaction between components,
    their composition, privacy protection issues,
    type systems for reasoning about the placement of data and computation.

My current research focuses on the design of languages for distributed systems
with a wide range of software architectures – e.g., peer-to-peer, cloud, edge, serverless, IoT –
regarding areas such as sound programming models for the interaction between components,
their composition, privacy protection issues,
type systems for reasoning about the placement of data and computation.

Within the [MAKI](https://www.maki.tu-darmstadt.de/){: target="_blank" } project,
I worked on complex event processing (CEP)
and multitier languages for developing modular distributed applications.
I’m the main developer of the [ScalaLoci]({{ '/projects/scala-loci' | relative_url }})
multitier programming language.

I served on the following committees:

* [APLAS ’25](https://conf.researchr.org/home/aplas-2025){: target="_blank" } (PC)
* [ECOOP ’25](https://2025.ecoop.org/){: target="_blank" } (PC)
* [ECOOP ’24](https://2024.ecoop.org/){: target="_blank" } (Web Chair)
* [OOPSLA ’23](https://2023.splashcon.org/track/splash-2023-oopsla){: target="_blank" } (PC)
* [ECOOP ’23](https://2023.ecoop.org/){: target="_blank" } (AEC, ERC, Web Co-Chair)
* [‹Programming› ’23](https://2023.programming-conference.org/){: target="_blank" } (AEC)
* [REBLS ’22](https://2022.splashcon.org/home/rebls-2022){: target="_blank" } (Chair) at SPLASH ’22
* [Workshop on Real-time Stream Analytics, Stream Mining, CER/CEP & Stream Data Management in Big Data ’22](https://workshop.euranova.eu/bigdata22.html){: target="_blank" } (PC) at IEEE BigData
* [ECOOP ’22](https://2022.ecoop.org/){: target="_blank" } (AEC, ERC).
* [Demos and posters](https://iot-conference.org/iot2021/call-for-posters-demos/){: target="_blank" } (Co-Chair) at IoT ’21
* [Workshop on Real-time Stream Analytics, Stream Mining, CER/CEP & Stream Data Management in Big Data ’21](https://workshop.euranova.eu/bigdata21.html){: target="_blank" } (PC) at IEEE BigData

## Short Bio

I got my PhD from the Departement of Computer Science at the Technical University of Darmstadt
under the supervision of Prof. Guido Salvaneschi in 2020.
My doctoral dissertation focuses on multitier programming
for developing distributed software systems.
I worked as a postdoc with Prof. Mira Mezini at the Technical University of Darmstadt until spring 2021.
I joined the Programming Group at the University of St. Gallen in May 2021.

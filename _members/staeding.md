I joined the Programming Group as a PhD student in November 2024 after completing my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/).

My research interest is at the intersection of programming language theory and distributed systems,
with a current focus on the safety and efficiency of distributed systems with loose consistency guarantees.
I am currently exploring formal frameworks for modular verification of Op-based CRDTs.

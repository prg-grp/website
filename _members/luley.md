I am a student researcher at the University of St. Gallen.
From September 2022 to September 2023, I worked for the Centre for AI of the ZHAW as a research assistant focusing on data-centric AI and MLOps.
From October 2023 on, I have worked for Julius BÃ¤r in the MLOps engineering team where I am responsible for our AI infrastructure, the GPU cluster and its software stack, but also for the memory-efficient serving of our ML models, mostly LLMs, and their parameter efficient fine-tuning.
Most recently,  I started on working on agentic RAG. Apart from that, I try to stay up-to-date in terms of the latest and greatest LLM research, and look into GPU programming (CUDA) and coding challenges (LeetCode).
In my free time, I enjoy hiking, sports, baking, and cooking.
